abstract = "A dynamic threat and disturbance rejected path reshaping method is proposed. The method is based upon parametric Bezier curve called Local Optimal Reshaping(LOR), which is easy to adjust the reference velocity for navigation. Before implementation, only minimal safe margin and maximum curvature are needed. The method also purposefully biases the reshaping region of each node, thus, it is computational efficient with easy implementation. Three parts are included in the whole path planner, which are kinematic path planner, disturbance rejector with path smoother, and dynamic threat avoided planner, respectively. LOR acts as main effector in disturbance rejector and dynamic threat avoided planner. Comparative simulations are provided in this paper, and results show that our method has good performance in tackling disturbance and dynamic threats."
